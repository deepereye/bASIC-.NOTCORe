// Lists all cases in the Godot class API, where deviations are considered appropriate (e.g. for safety).

// Open design decisions:
// * Should Godot types like Node3D have all the "obj level" methods like to_string(), get_instance_id(), etc; or should those
//   be reserved for the Gd<T> pointer? The latter seems like a limitation. User objects also have to_string() (but not get_instance_id())
//   through the GodotExt trait. This could be unified.
// * The deleted/private methods and classes deemed "dangerous" may be provided later as unsafe functions -- our safety model
//   needs to first mature a bit.

// NOTE: the methods are generally implemented on Godot types (e.g. AABB, not Aabb)
