//! # Background on the design of vector algebra types
//!
//! The basic vector algebra types like `Vector2`, `Matrix4` and `Quaternion` are re-implemented
//! here, with an API similar to that in the Godot engine itself. There are other approaches, but
//! they all have their disadvantages:
//!
//! - We could invoke API methods from the engine. The implementations could be generated, but it
//!   is slower and prevents inlining.
//!
//! - We could re-export type
