/// Helps with adding custom functionality:
/// * `init` constructors
/// * `to_string` method
/// * Custom register methods (builder style)
/// * All the lifecycle methods like `ready`, `process` etc.
///
/// This trait is special in that it needs to be used in combination with the `#[godot_api]`
/// proc-macro attribute to ensure proper registration of its methods. All methods have
/// default implementations, so you can select precisely which functionality you want to have.
/// Those default implementations are never called however, the proc-macro detects what you implement.
///
/// Do not call any of these methods directly -- they are an interface to Godot. Functionality
/// described here is available through other means (e.g. `init` via `Gd::new_default`).
