# Contributing to `gdext`

At this stage, we appreciate if users experiment with the library, use it in small projects and report issues and bugs they encounter.

If you plan to make bigger contributions, make sure to discuss them in a [GitHub issue] first. Since the library is evolving quickly, this avoids that multiple people work on the same thing or implement features in a way that doesn't work with other parts. Also don't hesitate to talk to the developers in the `#contrib-gdext` channel on [Discord]!
